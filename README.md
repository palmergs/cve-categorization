# README

This is a app for manually categorizing CVEs based on whether they are of potential interest or related to a given technology.

## Installation

Rough notes for installation.

### Requirements

* `node`
* `npm`
* `nvm` (not required byt makes things easier)

Starting rails server (from the project root dir)
* Update all .example files to the real versions based on your environment.
* `rake db:migrate` initialize the database
* `rake routes`
* `rake cve:by_year[2017]` load a year's worth of CVEs 
* `rails s -p 3030`

Starting ember server (ember-app dir)
* `brew install watchman`
* `npm install -g ember-cli`
* `npm install -g bower`
* `cd ember-app`
* `bower install`
* `npm install`
* `ember serve`

## Using the tool
Ember server runs on port 4200 by default. http://localhost:4200

Type in a technology, hit enter to create the intial technology.
Click on that technology name to view the full list of CVEs
Begin sorting the CVEs. Use the `<<` to mark a CVE as not applicable to this technology and use `>>` to mark a CVE as applicable. Use tags to mark CVEs containing that term as either unlikely to be applicable or likely.
